      <div class="long-intro">
        <p class="intro-item intro-item-1">
          I am a 22 year-old bachelor's student (undergrad). I was born and
          raised in Gaindakot Nepal, and currently reside in Gaindakot. In my
          free time, I enjoy coding and gaming, such as Simulations for coding
          and Valorant for gaming. I'm also passionate about Free and Open
          Source Softwares, and enjoy volunteering my time to make a difference.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-item intro-item-2">
          As for my educational background, I am an undergrad from Tribhuwan
          University. I gained experience in web development through local area
          projects. I'm always eager to learn and expand my skill set, which is
          why I'm doing web development.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-item intro-item-3">
          Overall, I am a empathetic, curious, and hardworking individual who is
          excited to see what the future holds. I'm looking forward to meeting
          new people, exploring new opportunities, and making a difference in
          the world.
